## About Me

I'm a tech-savvy engineering student obsessed with breaking down complex systems and rebuilding them cooler and cleaner. Currently knee-deep in Data Structure and Machine Learning because looks **do** matter in code.  
I'm the founder of [**Bound by Code**](https://instagram.com/bound_by_code), a digital playground where I build, break, and share bleeding-edge tech with other code warriors. I also run a digital solutions squad for brands that want to look like they belong in 2030.
